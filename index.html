            I am a self-motivated individual that scores high when it comes to
            both learning new and using existing soft-skills. <br />Proefficient
            team worker, just about as much as I am individually. In all my 15
            years of work experience in tens of different work-fields, I have
            gained the ability to solve any problems in more than one different
            way. <br />Currently very interested in the front-end aspect of
            web-development. <br />This particular career is a highly
            sophisticated challenge for me as I am brand new into it and I
            already consider it to be my definitive career path in which I'll
            never stop learning and self-developing as a human being.<br />Multiple
            active hobbies accrued throughout time which include all kinds of
            sports, mainly full-contact, charity work of all kinds whenever
            possible, cycling and photography.</strong>
